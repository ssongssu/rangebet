# IMPORTANT - READ THIS FIRST!

When working on the RangeBet project, ALWAYS refer to:

DEVELOPMENT_GUIDELINES.md

This file contains ALL critical information about:

- Version numbering (use v0.XX format)
- Deployment process (deploy from root, NOT public folder)
- Project structure and organization
- Component styling requirements
- Common issues and their solutions

Following these guidelines will save significant time and prevent repetitive explanations.

Key points to remember:
1. Firebase deploys from ROOT, not the public folder
2. Always increment version numbers (v0.13, v0.14, etc.)
3. Include version in page title and badge
4. Chat box has specific styling requirements
5. Wallet connection uses the chat-toggle button (green)

Any adjustments to these guidelines should be documented in DEVELOPMENT_GUIDELINES.md

To search project code effectively, use the search_files or search_code functions to find relevant files or content across the project.
